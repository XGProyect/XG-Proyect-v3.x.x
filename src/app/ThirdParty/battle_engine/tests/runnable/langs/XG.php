Advancements in shielding technology provided scientists with a way to develop a shield to protect an entire planet not only from space debris but, as it was learned, from an enemy attack. By creating a large electromagnetic field around the planet, space debris that would normally have destroyed the planet was deflected, and attacks from enemy Empires were thwarted. The first generators were large and the shield provided moderate protection, but it was later discovered that small shields did not afford the protection from larger scale attacks. The small shield dome was the prelude to a stronger, more advanced planetary shielding system to come.<br><br> After a battle, there is up to a 70 % chance that failed defensive facilities can be returned to use.";
