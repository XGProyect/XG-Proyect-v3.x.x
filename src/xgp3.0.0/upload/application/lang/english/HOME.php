<br/><br/>
I offer you the grandest of congratulations on entering into your regency and also I hope to be of help to you in your first steps.
<br/><br/>
On the left, you will see the menu, which will help you to control the fortunes of your galactic empire.
<br/><br/>
I`m sure you already know the `overview`. Under `Resources` and `Facilities` you can build the constructions you need to support your empire. Get the best start by improving your Solar Plant, so that you acquire energy and can supply the mines with this energy.
<br/><br/>
Subsequently, improve your metal and crystal mines to start producing the necessary resources. You can also just take a look around the menus, you will certainly be able to find your way around quite quickly.
<br/><br/>
